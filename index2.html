          <h2 class="text-center">Travelling Concepts</h2>
          <p>The Iberian Peninsula is both the originator and product of global colonization and its history constitutes a workshop for questioning how language constructs the world.  Concepts such as ‘global’, ‘culture’, ‘civilisation’, ‘tolerance’, ‘Europe’ and the binary East/ West are central to the way Iberian history has been imagined both inside and outside the Peninsula, from the Middle Ages to the present day. In a journey that takes us from Brazil to China, and through multiple languages, we investigate the ideological work performed by the vocabularies that historically cluster around Iberia, whether embedded in individual words, phrases or extended literary forms (narrative, lyric, history).</p>

          <h2 class="text-center">Translation Acts</h2>
          <p>In ‘Translation Acts’, the focus is on the creation of dramatic narratives through theatre in translation and performance. Here, we take up the ideas of travelling texts and the shifting meanings of, for example, the concepts ’global’ and ‘tolerance’ and explore the lived experience of how they represent the worlds we inhabit. Using the creative capacity of theatre to be world-inventing, to create known and imagined worlds on stage, we will question how ideas and beliefs cross cultures, time and space and how we act through the languages we use and create. Workshops will be based on using participants’ innate and learned language knowledge to translate and recreate theatre texts in ways that will radically intervene in our understanding of cultural co-existence in the present.</p>

          <h2 class="text-center">Digital Mediations</h2>
          <p>‘Digital Mediations’ will research the impact of digital culture on Modern Languages research, with a particular focus on Spanish Portuguese and Latin American studies. This strand will survey the current state of digital methods and tools applied to Modern Languages research and will encourage hands-on experimentation, prototyping and digital collaboration, using approaches used in new media studies, the digital humanities and other areas of digital studies. The research will explore methodologies for studying digital content from a multilingual perspective and will appraise the extent to which digital data, as a complex cultural product in its own right, represents a meaningful record accessible to ML research and learning.</p>

          <h2 class="text-center">Loaded Meanings</h2>
          <p>‘Loaded meanings’ invites reflection on the nature of language and its historical development by investigating the linguistic consequences of the single most important cultural contact observable in the history of the languages of western Europe, namely, the dissemination of learned borrowings (words borrowed directly from or coined on the basis of Latin or Greek) in Ibero-Romance.  Originally introduced in the written language of the culturally élite, a surprisingly large number of these words have percolated down into frequent everyday usage and so lie at the heart of ordinary speakers’ ‘worldmaking’, while at the same time often changing their original meanings in interesting ways.</p>

          <h2 class="text-center">Diasporic Identities</h2>
          <p>The broad aim of this research is to showcase the role of modern language teachers in the UK and challenge perceived attitudes and preconceptions about language teaching. We investigate how modern languages practitioners construct and express their personal and professional identities, including how they see themselves in their role of mediators between languages and cultures, and how they perform this role across different settings and learning environments.  Finally, we seek to develop innovative collaborations among different languages as well as between Language Departments, Language Centres, and schools.</p>
