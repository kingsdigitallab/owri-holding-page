          <h2>Post-Doctoral Research Assistants</h2>
          <p>Language Acts and Worldmaking is a flagship project funded by the AHRC Open World Research Initiative. In it we aim to illuminate the ways in which language empowers us by enabling us to construct our personal, local, transnational and spiritual identities, and constrains us by carrying unexamined ideological baggage. It is this dialectic that we call ‘worldmaking’. The project is made up of 6 research strands that provide different, but overlapping, perspectives on our central research questions, which explore language as a material and historical force, foregrounding language’s power to shape how we live, and realising the potential of Modern Language learning to open pathways between worlds past and present. <strong>We are seeking to recruit 5 Post-Doctoral Research Assistants who will each work on a specific strand, as well as across the project as a whole.</strong></p>
          <p>We are keen to receive applications from a broad range of disciplines, and so encourage those with a background in related areas of the Humanities or Social Sciences to apply. Similarly, although the initial focus of the project is Spanish and Portuguese language, we also encourage those with knowledge of other languages to apply.</p>
